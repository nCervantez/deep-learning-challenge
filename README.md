# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Model Performance Report
## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model created for Alphabet Soup, a non-profit organization that provides funding to various philanthropic projects. The deep learning model is designed to predict whether applicants for funding will be successful, based on a set of features related to their application and financial information.

## Results:

### Neural Network Configuration:

The deep learning model was initially designed with two layers and  sixteen neurons, along with relu activation functions. The specific architecture was determined through experimentation, and the choices were made based on trial and error. The final model contains three layers, each consisting of 32 neurons, with relu activation functions, and an output layer with the sigmoid activation function. The number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions were determined based on the complexity of the problem and the size of the dataset.

### Model Performance:

- The success of achieving the target model performance depends on the specific goals set for the project. Common metrics for evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. These metrics are used to determine the model's ability to correctly classify successful and unsuccessful applications.
  
- The model's performance is evaluated using a test dataset to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The performance is compared against the defined success criteria.

- The success of this model was based on an accurracy goal of 75% or greater in predicting the outcome of a loan.


### Steps to Increase Model Performance:

To improve the model's performance, various steps were taken:

- Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features can help the model make more accurate predictions.

- Hyperparameter tuning: Experimenting with different combinations of the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, learning rates, and batch sizes to find the optimal configuration.

- The "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS" Feature was dropped in order to improve the accuracy of the model. The model showed no improvement or deterioration when the column was dropped, indicating that the column had no major effect on the accuracy of the model.


### Data preprocessing: Scaling or normalizing input data and handling missing values can improve model performance.

- Step 1: Reading the Dataset
The first step in the preprocessing of the Charity Dataset is to read the data from the "charity_data.csv" file into a Pandas DataFrame:

- Step 2: Identifying Target and Feature Variables

In this dataset, we have identified the following variables:

  - Target Variable(s):
    - The target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL." This binary classification variable indicates whether an applicant's project was successful or not.

- Feature Variable(s):
  - The feature variables for our model are the remaining columns in the dataset, excluding "EIN" and "NAME." These features include information such as "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," and "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS."
We have removed the "EIN" and "NAME" columns, as they are neither targets nor features.

- Step 3: Determining the Number of Unique Values

We have determined the number of unique values for each column in the dataset using the nunique() method. This helps us understand the diversity of values in each feature.

- Step 4: Handling Categorical Variables

For columns with more than 10 unique values, we have determined the number of data points for each unique value. This information is useful for deciding how to handle categorical variables. If a column has a large number of unique values, it might be beneficial to group infrequent values into an "Other" category to prevent overfitting. This ensures that rare categories do not dominate the model's decision-making.

- Step 5: Encoding Categorical Variables
  
To prepare the data for modeling, we'll use one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into binary (0 or 1) columns. This ensures that the machine learning model can work with categorical data.

- Step 6: Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
  
We'll split the preprocessed data into a features array (X) and a target array (y). We'll use the train_test_split function to create training and testing datasets. This enables us to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- Step 7: Scaling Features
  
To ensure that the features are on the same scale, we'll use the StandardScaler from scikit-learn. This scales the training and testing features based on the statistical properties of the training data.

By following these preprocessing steps, we have prepared the data for machine learning modeling. The features are encoded, and the data is divided into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model is ready for training and evaluation.

## Summary:

The deep learning model created for Alphabet Soup is designed to predict the success of funding applicants based on various input features. The specific architecture of the neural network includes multiple layers with varying numbers of neurons and appropriate activation functions for each layer.

The success of the model depends on the defined target performance metrics, which can vary based on the organization's specific goals. Our goal for this particular model was an accuracy of 75% or greater. Further tuning and experimentation are often required to meet or exceed these targets. For this model, we were unable to achieve the goal, despite our various attempts at engineering the model, by changing activation types, number of neurons, and changing the features set for the model.

### Recommendation for a Different Model:

A different model that can be considered for this classification problem is the Random Forest Classifier. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that can handle both categorical and numerical features, and it can provide feature importance scores to help understand which variables are most influential in predicting success.
Random Forest is known for its ease of use and robust performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning, which can be a good option when computational resources are limited or when the dataset is not very large.
Using Random Forest can provide insights into the importance of different features and might lead to a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of funding applicants.
In summary, the deep learning model's performance can be improved through fine-tuning and experimentation, but considering alternative models like Random Forest can also be beneficial for gaining additional insights and potentially achieving the desired prediction accuracy.
